I am a Front End Developer, holding a degree of Bachelor's in Computer Science from FAST, NUCES (Lahore Campus.) Apart from that, I like exploring and learning new things. I love connecting with people and growing my network. I firmly believe in Empassion (Empathy+ Compassion) => I made that up.

I started my Career with Numtra AI. I have been working there for 1.5 years as a Frontend Developer.
Numtra AI is an AI Service that empowers Analysts and non-data scientists to leverage machine learning to solve business problems.

Some of my tasks in this role are; Developing, Designing, and managing the frontend of various components. Integrating APIs from different platforms such as MLFlow, Apache Airflow, and Apache Hadoop. Writing node side APIs, Fetching and saving Data in Database, invoking and sending data to Backend APIs. Analyzed company needs and develop the appropriate functionality, took requirements and implemented new features, and updated existing ones.

I graduated from FAST, Lahore in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my duration in university, I studied multiple programming courses some of which are Intro to Programming, OOP, Database Systems, Advanced Programming, Web Development, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Structures, and Algo but the course that had my interest was Web Development. I actively took part in events organized by university societies. I volunteered in Softec multiple times and was also a member of the ACM society.
